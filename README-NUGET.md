# Dynamic Query Extension

### Support

- Search
- Sort
- Filter with LHS Bracket syntax
- Pagination with offset pagination and Cursor Pagination

# How to use

The First parameter is the key word
The Second one is The Specific fields that You wanna search
The Third is how deep this could search

```csharp

dbContext.User
    .Search("rose",["name"], 1)
    .ToListAsync();

```

# Filter

To do filter in this template, we use LHS Brackets.

LHS is the way to encode operators is the use of square brackets [] on the key name.

For example

```
GET api/v1/users?filter[dayOfBirth][$gt]="1990-10-01"
```

This example indicates filtering out users whose birthdays are after 1990/10/01

All support operations:

| Operator      | Description                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| $eq           | Equal                               |

Some Examples:

```
GET /api/v1/users?filter[gender][$in][0]=1&filter[gender][$in][1]=2
```

```
GET /api/v1/users?filter[gender][$between][0]=1&filter[gender][$between][1]=2
```

```
GET /api/v1/users?filter[firstName][$contains]=abc
```

$and and $or operator:

```
GET /api/v1/users/filter[$and][0][firstName][$containsi]="sa"&filter[$and][1][lastName][$eq]="Tran"
```

```JSON
{
  "filter": {
    "$and": {
      "firstName": "sa",
      "lastName": "Tran"
    }
  }
}
```

```
GET /api/v1/users/filter[$or][0][$and][0][claims][claimValue][$eq]=admin&filter[$or][1][lastName][$eq]=Tran
```

```JSON
{
    "filter": {
        "$or": {
            "$and":{
                "claims": {
                    "claimValue": "admin"
                }
            },
            "lastName": "Tran"
        }
    }
}
```

'Cause I designed filter input based on [Strapi filter](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest/filters-locale-publication)

**To know how to binding from LHS to Dynamic object you could see my** [Clean Architecture Project Project](http://https://github.com/minhsangdotcom/clean-architecture)

[This file help you to grab filter string query](https://github.com/minhsangdotcom/clean-architecture/blob/main/src/Contracts/Binds/ModelBindingExtension.cs)

[This will help you how to binding from LHS to Dynamic object](https://github.com/minhsangdotcom/clean-architecture/blob/main/src/Application/Common/Extensions/StringExtension.LHSParser.cs)

```csharp
var query = httpContext?.Request.QueryString.Value;
string[] stringQuery = ModelBindingExtension.GetFilterQueries(query);

List<QueryResult> queries =
        [
            .. StringExtension.TransformStringQuery(stringQuery),
        ];
object filter = StringExtension.Parse(queries);
await dbContext.User.Filter(filter).ToListAsync();

```

**I'll Update full of them for the next version.**

### Sort

This example sorts users by name descending, then by age ascending when names are equal.

```csharp
await dbContext.User.sort("name:desc, age").ToListAsync();
```

### Pagination

Offset

```csharp
   await dbContext.User.ToPagedListAsync(1, 10);
```

Cursor

- Before : The previous Cursor
- After : The next cursor
- Size : Size of page
- Sort : User sort request
- UniqueSort : the property that is unique to make the mechanism work property, the default is Id:asc


```csharp
await dbContext.User.ToCursorPagedListAsync(request);
```
